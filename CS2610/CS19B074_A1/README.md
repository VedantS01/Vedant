## The problem statement

Given a sequence of integers(32-bit) as input. Compute the sum of the integers and print the
sum. Your program should first take the sequence size as input and then the sequence of integers.
The program should not print anything except for the sum. You can assume that the inputs
given, will not cause any overflow/underflow.

#### Input Format

First line would be N, Number of integers.

Next N lines will each contain and integer (int16 : ranged from -32768 to 32767)

#### Constraints

-32768 <= N <= 32767
Same range for every integer to be added
No overflow/underflow cases

#### Output Format

Prints the sum

# HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM

Give the inputs one by one in the **STDIN**

Output will be displayed on the **STDOUT**

**CS19B074.o:** An object file that will be generated in the process
**CS19B074:** A binary file that will be generated during the process

#### How to run the code

Open Linux command shell

Run the following command in the same folder :

~$ ./commands.txt

If the binary file **CS19B074** is already present, you can simply run this command instead :

~$ ./CS19B074
